- Integrate [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams et code blocks with syntax highlighting;
- Use [custom directives](#directives) to include others documents or generate tables of content;
- Use [pre-defined or custom layouts](#layouts) to transform your content into presentations, report, etc
- Use [Go templating](#variables-and-templating) to inject dynamic data into your document;
- Rewrite you relative links and embed external resources.
