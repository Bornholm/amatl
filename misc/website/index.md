## What's Amatl ?

Amatl is a simple command-line utility that can help you to transform your [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (also known as [Markdown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) files into full-fledged HTML/PDF documents. For example, this simple website is [generated with Amatl itself](https://github.com/Bornholm/amatl/blob/master/misc/website/index.md).
